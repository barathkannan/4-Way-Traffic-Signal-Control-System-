# 4-Way-Traffic-Signal-Control-System
4-Way Traffic Signal Control System Using Tia Portal

# Project Description
This project simulates a fully automated 4-way traffic light control system using a PLC with HMI, The system manages traffic flow at an intersection by coordinating the signals (Red, Yellow, Green) for four directions in a timed sequence. The program ensures that only one direction gets the green signal at a time while the others remain red, reducing the chances of accidents and improving traffic efficiency.
Additional features like pedestrian crossing, manual override, or vehicle sensors can be integrated to enhance real-time adaptability and smart city compatibility.

The HMI is used to monitor and control the system in real time, offering an interactive interface for operators.

# Key Features
Timed signal control for all four directions with safe transition delays

Only one direction gets the green signal at a time (avoids conflict)

HMI display showing current signal status for each direction
